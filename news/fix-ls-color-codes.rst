**Fixed:**

* $LS_COLORS code 'fi' now used for "regular files", as it should have been all along. (was 'rs') 
  See (#3608)[https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/3608].
* pyghooks.color_files now follows implememntation of ls --color closely.  Thanks @qwenger!
  However, a few documented differences remain due to use in Xonsh.

* $LS_COLORS['ln'] = 'target' now works.  Also fixes #3578.
